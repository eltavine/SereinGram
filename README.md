The upstream CMake target remains `Telegram`; the resulting desktop executable
is named `Nagram`. Builds require your own Telegram API credentials for
distribution. Upstream automatic updates are disabled; no Nagram update service
or store distribution has been configured.

Source code retains the upstream [GPLv3 license](LICENSE) and [legal notices](LEGAL).
